# 👨🏽‍💻 Solidity and Python Projects

Welcome to my learning repository! This is where I store all my practice projects as I grow my skills in **Solidity (Smart Contract Development)** and **Python (General Programming)**.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Solidity/` — Smart contracts and blockchain-based apps (e.g., SimpleStorage, Token contracts)
- `Python/` — Mini-projects and scripts (e.g., temperature converters, file handlers)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) — Ethereum smart contract language
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) — High-level programming language
- Git & GitHub — Version control and collaboration

## 🎯 My Goal

To become a skilled blockchain developer, starting from the basics and building real-world solutions for Ghana and beyond 🇬🇭.

## 📌 How to Contribute

I'm still learning, but feel free to share feedback or ideas! Pull requests and issues are welcome in the future.
